# github-relative-url-markdown
Demonstration repository to display an error in the relative URL handling in Markdown

Link to the test file in the `github` folder breaks if it's in a list:

*  [broken link 1](./github/test.txt)
* [broken link 2](./test/test.txt)


Referencing the [link](./github/test.txt) in text itself works.
