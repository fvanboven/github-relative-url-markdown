# github-relative-url-markdown
Demonstration repository to display an error in the relative URL handling in Markdown

Link to the test file in the `github` folder breaks if it's in a list:

* [Github-folder link is broken] (./github/test.txt)
* [Non-github-folder link works] (./test/test.txt)


Referencing the [link](./github/test.txt) in text itself works.
